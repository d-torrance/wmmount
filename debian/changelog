wmmount (1.0beta2-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Killed the `User config file not found' message to stderr, it's
    pointless.
  * Changed menu entry to be in Apps/System, although that's not quite
    perfect either, but it closes: #59654.
  * Small changes to the manual page.
  * Policy 3.2.1 compliant:
    + checks for DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS in debian/rules
    + moved wmmount and its manual page out of /usr/X11R6 (I kept the .1x
      suffix for the manual page although it's in /usr/share/man/man1, it
      won't hurt anything)
  * Updated Build-Depends:.
  * Cleaned up copyright file.

wmmount (1.0beta2-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream version. The config file syntax and command line
    arguments handling changed a lot, will produce errors and segfaults.
    So, a big fat warning is now in the postinst.
  * Included upstream config/system.wmmount.sh script in examples dir,
    and modified it to match file locations on Debian.
  * Updated update-wmmountrc to make it generate a new style .wmmount
    file. Renamed it to 'gen-wmmountrc', because it doesn't update any
    existing data, it just gen-erates new data, from /etc/fstab.
  * Updated upstream URL and wmmount.1x manual page. Moved the manpage
    from debian/wmmount.1x to wmmount.man, to be included in Makefile
    by default, and called 'install.man' rule, too.
