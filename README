THE AUTHOR:
===========

Sam Hawker <shawkie@geocities.com>

INSTALLING:
===========

xmkmf
make
strip wmmount
make install

mkdir /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/wmmount
cp lib/* /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/wmmount


DOCKAPP:
========

Dock applet functions for wmmount are now provided by the dockapp source
module. For information relating to these functions (eg. docking under Window
Maker) see the DOCKAPP file.


CONFIGURATION:
==============

The system-wide configuration file can now be generated automatically from
/etc/fstab by means of the system.wmmount.sh script. It requires awk (or gawk)
and can be found in the config directory.

./system.wmmount.sh >system.wmmount
cp system.wmmount /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/wmmount

Individual users can create their own configuration files, saving them as
~/.wmmount.


NOTE:
=====

Do not give wmmount suid or sgid permissions.

Proper use of fstab is all that is required (at least on Linux).


USAGE:
======

Press the "<" and ">" arrow buttons to select a mount point.

Press the mount button (the one with a bolt symbol) to mount or unmount.

Double-click in the information box to open a program (eg. Midnight Commander)
at the mount point.
