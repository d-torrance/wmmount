DOCKAPP:
========

This source module provides a set of common functions for use by dock applets.

The user interface to this set of functions is a set of command-line options
common to all dock applets. These dockapp options provide functions such as
docking, positioning and setting of colors.

usage:

   dockapp [options] [-- dockapp_options]

examples:

   dockapp -h

   dockapp -- -h

These examples will obtain different help messages. Try both before asking for
help.


WINDOWMAKER USERS:
==================

To dock a dock applet under Window Maker, use the '-w' dockapp option.

example:

   dockapp -- -w


AFTERSTEP USERS:
================
(thanks to tygris@erols.com)

To dock a dock applet in the AfterStep Wharf, use the '-a' dockapp option.

example:

   dockapp -- -a

There is also a '--position position' dockapp option which allows you to push
the dock applet off the edge of the screen while it gets swallowed.

example:

   dockapp -- -a --position -0-0

You will, of course, also need a line in AfterStep's .steprc file.

example:

   *Wharf dockapp nil MaxSwallow "dockapp" dockapp -- -a --position -0-0 &

The '-a' causes the dock applet to use a 56x56 pixel window. Since the Wharf
would usually prefer 55x57 pixel windows, some editing and recompiling of the
AfterStep sources is necessary for perfect results.

According to tygris@rols.com,

"Locate Wharf.c (or is it Wharf.cc?)  Should be in
AfterStep-1.0/modules/Wharf.  Locate this:

            if (Buttons[button].maxsize) {
              Buttons[button].icons[0].w = 55;
              Buttons[button].icons[0].h = 57;
            }

and change the 55 and 57 to 56's.  Save and compile."


DEFINES:
========

A number of defines are included in dockapp.h, strategic use of which should
allow you to reduce the number of options you specify on the command-line.

Note that the '-w', '-s' and '-a' options are toggles. This allows them to be
set by default in dockapp.h but then unset by their use on the command-line.
